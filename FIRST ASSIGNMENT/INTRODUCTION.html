    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <P>
        I am a veterinary student in my early 20s, passionate about learning and exploring new horizons in technology.
         Over the past year, I have immersed myself in the world of tech, and now I am excited to venture into the realm of front-end web development.
          My journey in both veterinary medicine and tech has fueled my curiosity and drive for continuous growth and learning.

    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
    <P>
        As a veterinary student, I have a strong foundation in biological sciences, anatomy, and medical concepts. 
        This background has honed my analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to work in diverse environments.
         Additionally, my recent venture into tech has allowed me to learn a few things on programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
         I have also dabbled in responsive web design, and basic web development frameworks but as a beginner.
